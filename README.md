# Energy-Disaggregation-Using-Deep-Neural-Networks-On-Household-Appliances

## Description 

This project contains my bachelor thesis (pdf) titiled Energy Disaggregation Using Deep Neural Networks on Household Appliances. 

## Problem Statement 

The aim of this thesis is to accurately and efficiently classify household appliances in small
time intervals (window) from the power consumption data of household appliances using
deep neural networks. The data which will be used for the household appliances to train the
neural network models is from the open source Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset
(REDD). While this thesis focuses on REDD dataset, the implementation provided can be
replicated to other datasets for energy disaggregation as the approach remains the same.
This thesis aims to implement Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to determine baseline accuracy
and thereafter, through researching relevant literature, determine and implement an
approach which further optimizes the accuracy.
